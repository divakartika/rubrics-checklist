*Bad Tooltip*

Bad tooltip typically use the original column name that sometimes are hard to read. The number is still in raw value, for example the GDP per Capita for Gabon is **13206.4845**. The number will be easier to read if presented as **13,206.4845** with comma separator for every 3 digits.

```
gdpPercap: 13206.4845
lifeExp: 56.735
```

*Good Tooltip*

```
Gabon (name of the country)
GDP per Capita: 13,206.48
Life Expectancy: 56.735
```

,Choosing right color scheme,Choosing right color scheme,FALSE,1,,Color must be carefully chosen to serve a purpose and it must be clear and do not distract the reader. One of the most common pitfalls is using color for bar charts when a large number of categories are present.
